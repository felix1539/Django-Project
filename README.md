# Django-Project
User login and signup pages using HTML, CSS, JS and Django 
I designed and implemented a secure and user-friendly login and signup system using a combination of front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, coupled with Django, a powerful Python web framework. 
This project showcases my proficiency in building interactive and responsive web interfaces. 
By integrating client-side validation with JavaScript and server-side logic with Django, I ensured a seamless user experience while prioritizing security. 
Users can register, log in, and access personalized accounts, demonstrating my skills in full-stack web development.
